# AngularClickCounter

This is a simple project, which I made to understand how some features of Angular's work. Like most of first time apps it is a click counter.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2. 


## Development server

To run this project, locally, you need to have npm installed.

If you don't have Angular CLI installed, you can run `npm run start`, which will open the server locally, on port 4200.

Otherwise, simply, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
